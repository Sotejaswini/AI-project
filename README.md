# 🧠 AI Sudoku Solver Using OCR 🎯  

## 📖 Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered Sudoku Solver** that leverages **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** and **Deep Learning** to automatically detect, extract, and solve Sudoku puzzles from images. It uses **computer vision** to preprocess images, a **CNN-based model** to recognize digits, and a **backtracking algorithm** to solve the Sudoku grid.

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Digit Recognition:** Uses a trained deep learning model to recognize numbers in the Sudoku grid.  
✅ **Image Processing:** Uses OpenCV to extract and preprocess Sudoku grids from images.  
✅ **Sudoku Solving Algorithms:** Implements optimized backtracking and constraint propagation algorithms.  
✅ **Pre-trained Models:** Includes pre-trained models for easy deployment.  
✅ **Supports Custom Input Images:** Can solve Sudoku puzzles from scanned or captured images.
