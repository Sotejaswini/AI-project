# AI Sudoku Solver Using OCR

## üìñ Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered Sudoku Solver** that leverages **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** and **Deep Learning** to automatically detect, extract, and solve Sudoku puzzles from images. It uses **computer vision** to preprocess images, a **CNN-based model** to recognize digits, and a **backtracking algorithm** to solve the Sudoku grid.

## üöÄ Features  
‚úÖ **Digit Recognition:** Uses a trained deep learning model to recognize numbers in the Sudoku grid.  
‚úÖ **Image Processing:** Uses OpenCV to extract and preprocess Sudoku grids from images.  
‚úÖ **Sudoku Solving Algorithms:** Implements optimized backtracking and constraint propagation algorithms.  
‚úÖ **Pre-trained Models:** Includes pre-trained models for easy deployment.  
‚úÖ **Supports Custom Input Images:** Can solve Sudoku puzzles from scanned or captured images.

## üîß Installation & Setup  

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sotejaswini/AI-project.git
cd AI-project
```

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**  

```bash
pip install keras
pip install opencv-python  # This is what "computer vision" refers to
pip install imutils
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn   # sklearn is installed as scikit-learn
```

### **Step 3: Train the Model (If Needed)**  
To train the digit recognition model, run:  
```bash
python model/train_model.py
```
- This will create a trained model (`model.h5`) in the `model/` folder.  
- Pre-trained models are already provided if you want to skip training.

## üéÆ How to Run  

### **Solve a Sudoku Puzzle from an Image**  
Run the following command:  
```bash
python main.py <path_to_input_image> <path_to_model>
```

#### **Example:**  
```bash
python main.py ./input/sudoku.jpg ./model/model.h5
```
- The solved Sudoku will be saved as **`solved_sudoku.jpg`**.

## üìä Testing & Evaluation  
The `stats_calculation` folder contains additional scripts for performance testing.  
Refer to **`howtouse.txt`** for details on how to use these scripts.
